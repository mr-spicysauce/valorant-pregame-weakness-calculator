# Valorant Pregame Weakness Calculator
(for now just a consept)

# What is it?
This would be a website where when you are loading into your game you could select what agents you are up agent and it will tell you the strengths and weaknesses of their agent selection and possible things you could
do to punish their weaknesses. For example, it could point out that they do not have any recon abilities such as a Skye dog or Sova drone, and it would tell you that hiding in unexpected corners might be effective
when fighting them. For high-rated players in Immortal or Radiant, this is very simple and they do this subconsciously, however for lower-rated players it's not always obvious or they forget to think about these things

# future plans
For now, this is just a concept to practice web development but I will try to this project to work well. I would also like to have a place where you can enter in your own team and it will tell you things to be aware of
such as no trip for flank. I would also like to add a thing where it will see if you or your team is following the agent meta for the map you are playing.
Another idea is to compare the 2 teams' agent picks with data pulled from valo tracker to calculate the win rate of your team's agent picks.
